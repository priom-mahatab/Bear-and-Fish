# Bear and Fish Ecosystem Simulation
This project simulates an ecosystem in a river, where bears and fish live, move, and interact. The simulation models the movement of bears and fish, their reproduction, and encounters between them, where bears eat fish.

## Overview
The Bear and Fish Ecosystem Simulation is a simple command-line simulation where bears and fish move in a river. Bears and fish can reproduce when they meet creatures of the same type. If a bear encounters a fish, the fish will be eaten. The ecosystem continues running as creatures move randomly within the river.

## Features
* Bears and fish can move to adjacent spaces in the river.
* Creatures of the same type can reproduce if they encounter each other.
* Bears eat fish when they encounter them.
* The simulation can be customized in terms of the size of the river and the number of bears and fish.

## Installation
To use this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/priom-mahatab/Bear-and-Fish.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Bear-and-Fish
```
3. Ensure you have Python installed on your macine (Python 3.x recommended).

## Usage
To run the simulation, open a terminal in the project directory and execute the following command:
```
python main.py
```
You can customize the number of bears and fish as well as the size of the ruver by modifying main.py file or providing them as inputs in the command line interface.
